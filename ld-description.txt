# Start Wreck: The Finite Frontier Ô∏è#


The endless void of space sure feels a lot smaller when it's cluttered with space garbage.

Boldly go where no one has gone before in the explore-and-escape space simulator Start Wreck: The Finite Frontier!

Navigate your ship through a veritable sea of space-junk as you try to find your way to a new, unpolluted home.

Visit the waypoint in each sector of the map to reveal more of the surrounding area so you can pilot your way to freedom.

# Controls:
---
**Click and Drag**: Launch your ship. The further back you pull the faster you go - but be careful! More speed also means more damage.

**Scroll/Mousewheel**: zoom in and out of the map. Use the minimap to see which sectors you still need to clear.
